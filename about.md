# 🧑‍💻 About Aaron (darkaaron999)

Hi! I’m **Aaron**, a gamer, developer, digital creator, and UI enthusiast.

I love building:

- 🎮 Game-inspired apps  
- ⚡ Neon cyberpunk interfaces  
- 🛠 Tools that feel like they belong inside an RPG or sci-fi world  
- 📱 Mobile + web experiences with clean UX  

## 🔥 My Skills

- **Languages:** Swift, Kotlin, JavaScript, HTML/CSS  
- **Frameworks:** SwiftUI, Jetpack Compose, React  
- **Game-style UI:** neon, pixel-style, HUD-style layouts  
- **Other:** Firebase, JSON APIs, GitHub Pages, Xcode  

## 🎯 My Vision

I merge gaming aesthetics with real-world development.  
Everything I build has a **style**, not just functionality.

If a UI glows… I probably made it. 💡😄
